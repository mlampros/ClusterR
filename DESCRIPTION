Description: Gaussian mixture models, k-means, mini-batch-kmeans, k-medoids and affinity propagation clustering with the option to plot, validate, predict (new data) and estimate the optimal number of clusters. The package takes advantage of 'RcppArmadillo' to speed up the computationally intensive parts of the functions.
