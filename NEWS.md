## ClusterR 1.0.3

I updated the dissimilarity functions to accept data with missing values. Moreover, I added an error exception in the predict_GMM() function in case that the determinant is equal to zero. The latter is possible if the data includes highly correlated variables or variables with low variance.


## ClusterR 1.0.2

## ClusterR 1.0.1

I modified the RcppArmadillo functions so that ClusterR passes the Windows and OSX OS package check results
